Client Tool Drivers
===================

Client tool drivers allow Bcfg2 to execute configuration operations by
interfacing with platform and distribution specific tools.

Tool drivers handle any reconfiguration or verification operation. So
far we have tools that primarily deal with packaging systems and service
management. The POSIX tool also handles file system and permissions/groups
operations.

To write your own tool driver, to handle a new packaging format, or new
service architecture see :ref:`development-index-writingtooldrivers`

When the Bcfg2 client is run, it attempts to instantiate each of these
drivers. The succeeding list of drivers are printed as a debug message
after this process has completed. Drivers can supercede one another,
for example, the Yum driver conflicts (and unloads) the RPM driver. This
behavior can be overridden by running the Bcfg2 client with the -D
flag. This flag takes a colon delimited list of drivers to use on
the system.

Currently these are the tool drivers that are distributed with Bcfg2:

Action
------

Pre and post-install tests and actions. This driver executes commands
and supplies status information to the Bcfg2 server via the statistics
mechanism. It can also be used to prevent bundle installation when
pre-conditions are not met. See the UsingActions page for more details.

APT
---

Debian Packages. This tool driver is used to handle packages on dpkg
based systems and employs the "apt" executable. Extra information can be
found at :ref:`client-tools-apt`.

Blast
-----

Blastwave Packages. This tool driver is for blastwave packages on solaris

Chkconfig
---------

Tool to manage services (primarily on Redhat based distros).

.. note:: Start and stop are standard arguments, but the one for reload
          isn't consistent across services. You can specify which argument
          to use with the `restart` property in Service tags. Example:
          ``<Service name="ftp" restart="condrestart" status="on"
          type="chkconfig">``

DebInit
-------

Debian Service Support; exec's update-rc.d to configure services.

Encap
-----

`Encap <http://www.encap.org>`_ Packages.

FreeBSDInit
-----------

FreeBSD Service Support. Only bundle updates will work.

FreeBSDPackage
--------------

FreeBSD Packages. Verifies packages and their version numbers but can't
install packages.

launchd
-------

Mac OS X Services. To use this tool, you must maintain a standard launch
daemon .plist file in ``/Library/LaunchDaemons/`` (example ssh.plist)
and setup a ``<Service name="com.openssh.sshd" type="launchd" status="on"
/>`` entry in your config to load or unload the service. Note the name
is the ''Label'' specified inside of the .plist file

Portage
-------

Support for Gentoo Packages.

POSIX
-----

Files and Permissions are handled by the POSIX driver. Usage well
documented other places.

RcUpdate
--------

Uses the rc-update executable to manage services on distributions such
as Gentoo.

RPM
---

.. warning:: Deprecated in favor of :ref:`RPMng <client-tools-yumng>`

Executes rpm to manage packages most often on redhat based systems.

RPMng
-----

Next-generation RPM tool, will be default in upcoming release. Handles
RPM sublties like epoch and prelinking and 64-bit platforms better than
RPM client tool. :ref:`client-tools-yumng`

SMF
---

Solaris Service Support.

Example legacy run service (lrc):

.. code-block:: xml

    <BoundService name='/etc/rc2_d/S47pppd' FMRI='lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S47pppd' status='off' type='smf'/>

SYSV
----

Handles System V Packaging format that is available on Solaris.

Upstart
-------

Upstart service support. Uses `Upstart`_ to configure services.

.. _Upstart: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/

Yum
---

.. warning:: Deprecated in favor of :ref:`YUMng <client-tools-yumng>`

Handles RPMs using the YUM package manager.

YUMng
-----

Handles RPMs using the YUM package manager. Handles sublties better than
the Yum client tool. :ref:`client-tools-yumng`
