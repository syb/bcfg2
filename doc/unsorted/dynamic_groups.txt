Dynamic Groups
==============

Bcfg2 supports the use of dynamic groups. These groups are not included
in a client's profile group, but instead are derived from the results
of probes executed on the client. These dynamic groups need not already
exist in ``Metadata/groups.xml``. If a dynamic group is defined in
``Metadata/groups.xml``, clients that include this group will also get
all included groups and bundles.

Setting up dynamic groups
=========================

In order to define a dynamic group, setup a probe that outputs the text
based on system properties::

    group:groupname

This output is processed by the Bcfg2 server, and results in dynamic
group membership in groupname for the client. See the :ref:`Probes
<server-plugins-probes-index>` page for a more thorough description
of probes.
