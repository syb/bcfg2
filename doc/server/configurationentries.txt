Configuration Entries

This page describes the names and semantics of each of the configuration
entries used by Bcfg2.

POSIX entries
=============

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0

The unified POSIX Path entries prevent inconsistent configuration
specifications of multiple entries for a given path. The following table
describes the various types available for new **Path** entries.

The abstract specification of these entries (i.e. In `Bundler`_)
will only contain a *name* attribute. The type will be added by the
plugin that handles the entry in the case of `Cfg`_, `TGenshi`_, or
`TCheetah`_. If the entry is handled by the `Rules`_ plugin (i.e. it is
a device, directory, hardlink, symlink, etc), then you will specify both
the *type* and any other necessary attributes in `Rules`_.

.. note:: A tool for converting old POSIX entries is available in the
          Bcfg2 source directory at tools/posixunified.py

.. _boundentries:

Bound Entries
=============

This feature is a mechanism to specify a full entry at once from
a bundle. Traditionally, entries are defined in two stages. First,
an abstract entry is defined in a bundle. This entry includes a type
(the XML tag) and a name attribute. Then this entry is bound for
a client, providing the appropriate instance of that entry for the
client. Specifying a bound entry short-circuits this process; the only
second stage processing on Bound entries is to remove the "Bound" prefix
from the element tag. The use of a bound entry allows the single stage
definition of a complete entry. Bound entries can be used for any type.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle name='ntp'>
       <BoundPackage name='ntp' type='deb' version='1:4.2.4p4+dfsg-3ubuntu2.1'/>
    </Bundle>

Fun and Profit using altsrc
===========================

Altsrc is a generic, bcfg2-server-side mechanism for performing
configuration entry name remapping for the purpose of data binding.

Use Cases
---------

* Equivalent configuration entries on different architectures with
  different names

* Mapping entries with the same name to different bind results in a
  configuration (two packages with the same name but different types)

* A single configuration entry across multiple specifications
  (multi-plugin, or multi-repo)

Examples
--------

* Consider the case of ``/etc/hosts`` on linux and ``/etc/inet/hosts`` on
  solaris. These files contain the same data in the same format,
  and should typically be synchronized, however, exist in different
  locations. Classically, one would need to create one entry for each
  in `Cfg`_ or `TCheetah`_ and perform manual synchronization. Or,
  you could use symlinks and pray. Altsrc is driven from the bundle
  side. For example:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <Bundle name='netinfo'>
         <Group name='solaris'>
           <Path name='/etc/inet/hosts' altsrc='/etc/hosts'/>
         </Group>
         <Group name='linux'>
           <Path name='/etc/hosts'/>
         </Group>
      </Bundle>

  In this case, when a solaris host gets the 'netinfo' bundle, it will
  get the first Path entry, which includes an altsrc parameter. This
  will cause the server to bind the entry as if it were a Path
  called ``/etc/hosts``. This configuration entry is still called
  ``/etc/inet/hosts``, and is installed as such.

* On encap systems, frequently multiple packages of the same name, but
  of different types will exist. For example, there might be an openssl
  encap package, and an openssl rpm package. This can be dealt with
  using a bundle like:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <Bundle name='openssl'>
         <Package name='openssl' altsrc='openssl-encap'/>
         <Package name='openssl' altsrc='openssl-rpm'/>
      </Bundle>

  This bundle will bind data for the packages "openssl-encap" and
  "openssl-rpm", but will be delivered to the client with both packages
  named "openssl" with different types.

* Finally, consider the case where there exist complicated, but
  completely independent specifications for the same configuration entry
  but different groups of clients. The following bundle will allow the use
  of two different `TCheetah`_ templates ``/etc/firewall-rules-external``
  and ``/etc/firewall-rules-internal`` for different clients based on
  their group membership.

  .. code-block:: xml

      <Bundle name='firewall'>
         ...
         <Group name='conduit'>
           <Path name='/etc/firewall-rules' altsrc='/etc/firewall-rules-external'/>
         </Group>
         <Group name='internal'>
           <Path name='/etc/firewall-rules' altsrc='/etc/firewall-rules-internal'/>
         </Group>
      </Bundle>

* Consider the case where a variety of files can be constructed by a
  single template (`TCheetah`_ or `TGenshi`_). It would be possible to
  copy this template into the proper location for each file, but that
  requires proper synchronization upon modification and knowing up front
  what the files will all be called. Instead, the following bundle allows
  the use of a single template for all proper config file instances.

  .. code-block:: xml

      <Bundle name='netconfig'>
        <Path name='/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0' altsrc='/etc/ifcfg-template'/>
        <Path name='/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1' altsrc='/etc/ifcfg-template'/>
        <Path name='/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2' altsrc='/etc/ifcfg-template'/>
      </Bundle>

  altsrc can be used as a parameter for any entry type, and can be used
  in any structure, including `Bundler`_ and `Base`_.
